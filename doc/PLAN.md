# SLogo Team 05 Design Documentation

## Introduction
This section describes the problem your team is trying to solve by writing this program, the primary design goals of the project (i.e., where is it most flexible), and the primary architecture of the design (i.e., what is closed and what is open). Discuss the program at a high-level (i.e., without referencing specific classes, data structures, or code).

For this project, our group will create a modular system to interpret Simple Logo (SLogo) commands and display a turtle in a graphic interface that follows a path based on the SLogo commands.  The primary design goals involve developing practical API's that will allow us to create streamlined code as we progress through the project.

## Overview
This section serves as a map of your design for other programmers to gain a general understanding of how and why the program was divided up, and how the individual parts work together to provide the desired functionality. Describe the four APIs you intend to create (their purpose with regards to the program's functionality, and how they collaborate with each other) focusing specifically on the behavior, not the internal state. Include a picture of how the components are related (these pictures can be hand drawn and scanned in, created with a standard drawing program, or screen shots from a UML design program). Discuss specific classes, methods, and data structures, but not individual lines of code.

## User Interface
This section describes how the user will interact with your program (keep it simple to start). Describe the overall appearance of program's user interface components and how users interact with these components (especially those specific to your program, i.e., means of input other than menus or toolbars). Include one or more pictures of the user interface (these pictures can be hand drawn and scanned in, created with a standard drawing program, or screen shots from a dummy program that serves as a exemplar). Also describe any erroneous situations that are reported to the user (i.e., bad input data, empty data, etc.). This section should go into as much detail as necessary to cover all your team wants to say.



## Design Details
This section describes each API introduced in the Overview in detail (as well as any other sub-components that may be needed but are not significant to include in a high-level description of the program). Describe how each API supports specific features given in the assignment specification, what resources it might use, how it is intended to be used, and how it could be extended to include additional requirements (from the assignment specification or discussed by your team). Finally, justify the decision to create each class introduced with respect to the design's key goals, principles, and abstractions. This section should go into as much detail as necessary to cover all your team wants to say.

## API as Code
Your APIs should be written as Java interfaces, types that cannot contain instance variables or private methods, in appropriate packages. These should be Java code files that compile and contain extensive comments to explain the purpose of each interface and each method within the interface (note this code can be generated directly from a UML diagram). Include any Exceptions you plan to throw because of errors that might occur within your methods. Note, this does not require that all of these types will remain as interfaces in the final implementation, just that the goal is for you to focus on each type's behavior and purpose. Also include the steps needed to complete the Use Cases below to help make your ideas more concrete.

### External Front-end




### Internal Front-end





### External Back-end





### Internal Back-end





## Design Considerations
This section describes any issues which need to be addressed or resolved before attempting to devise a complete design solution. Include any design decisions that the group discussed at length and describe at least one alternative in detail (including pros and cons from all sides of the discussion). Describe any assumptions or dependencies regarding the program that impact the overall design. This section should go into as much detail as necessary to cover all your team wants to say.

## Team Responsibilities
This section describes the program components each team member plans to take primary and secondary responsibility for and a high-level plan of how the team will complete the program.

* Michael Castro (front-end)
    * Primary responsibility: The visualization â€“ mainly the user interface (like buttons, code input, etc).
    * Secondary responsibility: The reader class to help with syntax error.
* Amber Johnson (front-end)
    * Primary responsibility: The reader class and error checking for user-input
    * Secondary responsibility:  The visualization, including accepting user-input through buttons and command line, and displaying the turtle to the user
* Eric Han (back-end)
    * 
* Ha Nguyen (back-end)
