 # Addition
 
 ## Estimation:
 ### How long I think it will take: 
 
 30 minutes - 1 hour
 
 ### How many files to add and update:
 
 I will need to add 2 files: one for the Stamp command and one for the ClearStamps command. I will also need to change a
 properties file (though I cannot remember the exact name) that defines the commands in order to allow these to be recognized
 as valid commands. Last, I may need to change the TurtleHistory class to process these commands.
