CompSci 308: SLogo Addition
===

# Before

### Estimation

 * How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
     * I think it will take aorund 30 minutes to an hour. I need to take some time to review the code.

 * How many files will you need to add or update? Why?
     * At a high level, I think that all files under the turtle screen package could be updated. I am also open to the idea of creating a new class to carry this task.



# After

### Review

 * How long did it take you to complete this new feature?
     * It took about an hour and half.

 * How many files did you need to add or update? Why?
     * I updated one, the Visualization class, and I added a new file. I created the ImageCollection class which is used to display all the possible images.

 * Did you get it completely right on the first try? If not, why not?
     * I struggled at first. I think it was really hard to come back to an old code base after so long, especially after working on this last, final project.


### Analysis

 * What do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation --- was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
     * I think the documentation was not as good as I remembered. In hindsight, I felt that we documented a good amount but not enough. By this, I mean that we did not consider the fact that we need the information and design to be good enough that it easy to work on the code after time passes. I think we could have done a better job at explaining certain issues. 

 * What about the design or documentation could be improved?
     * As mentioned in the previous question, I think the biggest place for improvement is documentation. I think the code is pretty clear.

 * What would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
     * I think it would have been difficult for some programmers. I think we did not do our best when it came to naming of variables, classes, and methods which can lead to some confusion.
